# Final Session Prompt (Security + Deployment)

CONTEXT: Run {{ run }} of {{ total }}. Date: {{ date }} IST. FINAL session of this cycle.

Read your heartbeat first. Then:
1. Fix any failing build immediately if present.
2. Full security review (OWASP: injection, auth, exposed secrets, vulnerable dependencies).
3. Production readiness check (performance, error logging, SEO/meta, scalability).
4. Fix every issue found - there is no next session.
5. Write HEARTBEAT/DEPLOY_GUIDE.md: deployment steps, env vars, known risks, rollback procedure.
6. Update the heartbeat and mark the cycle complete.
