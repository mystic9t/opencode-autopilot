# Final Session Prompt

CONTEXT: Final session of {{ total }}. This is the wrap-up.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Run Self-Review

Use the `self-review` skill to audit all changes made during this cycle:
- List all commits made
- Identify any bloat or over-engineering
- Simplify where possible
- Remove dead code

### 2. Verify Everything Works

Use the `verify` skill:
- All tests pass
- No linting errors
- Build succeeds
- No regressions

### 3. Security Review

Check for common issues:
- Hardcoded secrets or credentials
- SQL injection risks
- Unvalidated user input
- Missing authentication checks
- Sensitive data in logs

### 4. Update Documentation

- README.md reflects current features
- BLUEPRINT.md is up to date
- HEARTBEAT/STATE.md has final status

### 5. Create Deliverables

Write `HEARTBEAT/DEPLOY_GUIDE.md` with:
- How to build the project
- How to run tests
- Environment variables needed
- Deployment steps
- Known issues or limitations

### 6. Final Commit

Commit all final changes with message:
```
chore: final session cleanup and documentation
```

## If Issues Found

Fix them now. This is your last chance before the cycle ends.

## Update HEARTBEAT/STATE.md

```markdown
# Project State

Status: complete
Last Session: Final review and documentation
Deliverables: DEPLOY_GUIDE.md created
Remaining Issues: [none / list if any]
Needs User Input: [any manual steps needed]
```

## Rules

- A clean finish is better than a featureful mess
- Document what was built
- Note what's left for future cycles
