# GG Blueprint Prompt

GG CONTEXT: Run {{ run }} of {{ total }}. Date: {{ date }} IST.

The previous session researched the space and wrote README.md with an autonomous product decision.
Your ONLY job this session is to read README.md and produce BLUEPRINT.md.

Do NOT write application code. Do NOT scaffold folders yet.

BLUEPRINT.md must contain:
- Project summary (derived from README)
- Tech stack with reasoning (default: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
- Top-level folder structure
- Core data models and key types
- The 5 most important features to build first, in priority order
- Definition of what a successful overnight cycle looks like
- Free external APIs, libraries, or data sources you plan to use
- A "Must NOT build in this cycle" list

This is the architectural constitution for all future sessions. Think deeply before writing.
Commit BLUEPRINT.md as a standalone commit.
