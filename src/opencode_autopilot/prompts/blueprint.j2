# Blueprint Prompt (Build mode)

BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT: Run {{ run }} of {{ total }}. Date: {{ date }} IST.

Your ONLY job this session is to produce BLUEPRINT.md in the project root.
Do NOT write any application code. Do NOT scaffold folders yet.

Determine what kind of project this is:
- If README.md exists -> read it as your primary source of intent.
- If no README but source code exists -> read the directory structure and key source files to infer product, stack, and intent.
- If neither exists -> write an opinionated BLUEPRINT.md for a generic modern web app and document your assumptions.

BLUEPRINT.md must contain:
- Project summary
- Tech stack with reasoning
- Top-level folder structure
- Core data models and key types
- Top 5 features to build first, in priority order
- Definition of a successful overnight cycle
- Free external APIs or libraries you plan to use
- A "Must NOT build in this cycle" list

This is the architectural constitution for all future sessions.
Commit BLUEPRINT.md as the only commit this session.
