# Build Session Prompt

BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT: Run {{ run }} of {{ total }}. Date: {{ date }} IST. Sessions remaining: {{ remaining }}.

You are being re-triggered. This is a continuation, not a fresh start.
Read your heartbeat and BLUEPRINT.md before doing anything else.
Do not deviate from the blueprint stack or data model without writing BLUEPRINT_AMENDMENT_<date>.md first.
Work for the full session. Do not stop early. Commit real progress.
