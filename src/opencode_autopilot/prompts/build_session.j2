# Build Session Prompt

BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT: Run {{ run }} of {{ total }}. Sessions remaining: {{ remaining }}.

You are being re-triggered. Read HEARTBEAT/ and BLUEPRINT.md before doing anything else.

## Build Process

1. **Read the Blueprint** - BLUEPRINT.md has the architecture and priorities
2. **Check Progress** - Read HEARTBEAT/ files to see what's done
3. **Pick Next Feature** - Follow blueprint priority order
4. **Implement** - Write clean, working code
5. **Verify** - Run tests, fix issues
6. **Commit** - Use the commit skill for disciplined commits

## User Direction

Check for user input:
- `NEXT.md` - User's explicit priorities (overrides blueprint)
- `ROADMAP.md` - Long-term goals

## Quality Gates

Before committing:
- Tests pass (run `verify` skill)
- Code follows project style
- No TODOs left in critical paths
- One logical change per commit

## If Blocked

- Write `PLAN_*.md` with proposed approach
- Update `HEARTBEAT/STATE.md` noting the blocker
- Move to a different feature

## Rules

- Don't deviate from blueprint without writing BLUEPRINT_AMENDMENT_*.md
- One feature at a time
- Working code > Clever code
- Commit real progress, not experiments
