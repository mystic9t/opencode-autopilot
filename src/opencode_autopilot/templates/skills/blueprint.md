# Blueprint Skill

To CREATE:

1. Read README.md if present. Otherwise read directory structure and key source files.
2. Write BLUEPRINT.md with: project summary, tech stack, folder structure, data models, top 5 features, success definition, free APIs/libraries, must-not-build list.
3. Commit as a standalone commit.

To AMEND:

1. Write BLUEPRINT_AMENDMENT_<date>.md - what is changing, why, what existing code is affected.
2. Update BLUEPRINT.md with the amendment applied.
3. Commit both files together.
